    <h1>Merry Christmas 2025</h1>

    <p>In Denmark christmas is now, actually it started months ago, when some radios started to play the christmas songs. 
      My favorite is not "Last Christmas" by Wham!, but "Driving home for christmas" by Chris Rea. 
      Chris Rea just died the other day- RIP. 
      Or some of the Danish songs that keeps showing up "Jul Det' Cool" by MC Ejnar, "Tinka" and so forth. 
      Or really old ones "Skal vi klippe vores julehjerter sammen i en præstegård med rigtig julesne" 
      (In English 'Do you want to cut our <a href="https://digitalassets.sallinggroup.com/image/upload/Digital/SEO/Fester-og-gaester/119725_Bilka_F_G_2019_Skabelon_Jul_Julehjerte_AD01_HV" target="_blank">Christmas heart</a> together in a parsonage with real Christmas snow').

      Today the entire family is home this morning - the kids are sleeping. 
      They all have after-school jobs in bakeries or supermarkets - they are opened so some of them go to work.
      As parents we want them to learn to have a job, for them the interesting thing is to earn money for their own stuff.
